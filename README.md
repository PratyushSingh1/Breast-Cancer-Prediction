# Breast Cancer Prediction


This project is an example of machine learning classification model to predict if a breast mass is benign or malignant. The aim of the project is to assist doctors in making more accurate diagnoses and recommending appropriate treatments.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system along with the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* seaborn
* matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip. For example:

```
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

The project contains a Jupyter notebook file `Breast Cancer Prediction.ipynb` that walks through the entire machine learning process step-by-step. To run the notebook, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Then open the notebook file and follow the instructions.

The data used for machine learning can be found in the `data` folder. It contains a CSV file `breast_cancer_data.csv` that contains various features of breast masses and their corresponding diagnosis (benign or malignant).
